# fvtt-module-pf2e-MonsterMaker
A Foundry VTT module designed for Pathfinder 2E System, that allows you to create combat NPCs from scratch, using values from the Pathfinder 2e Building Creatures Guide: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995

To use the Monster Maker, you have to create a blank NPC. Using a non-blank sheet is possible, but DCs and other special abilities will not scale. 

When you open its Character Sheet, you can find a button at the top. Clicking this button will open the monster builder.
In there, you either use one of the roadmaps, allowing you to set values automatically for a given monster type, or you could create your unique creature by changing any of the drop-down menus.

By default, all values are moderate, meaning you will get a creature that does not possess strengths or weaknesses. If you are planning to use your values rather than roadmaps, please take a look at the Creature Building Guide to see how to create a balanced monster: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995. Whenever you give a monster a strength, don't forget to give it a weakness to compensate. When you are happy with your values for the monster, click the "Submit" button. This will override the current values on the sheet.
