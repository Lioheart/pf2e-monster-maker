# fvtt-module-pf2e-MonsterMaker
A Foundry VTT module to create combat NPCs from scratch, using values from the Pathfinder 2e Building Creatures Guide: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995

To use the Monster Maker you have to create a blank NPC. Using a non-blank sheet is possible, but DCs and other special abilities will not scale. 
When you open its Character Sheet, you can find a button at the top. Clicking this button will open the monster builder.
In here, you can name a monster and either use one of the roadmaps, allowing it to set values automatically for a given monster type or you could create your own one by changing any of the drop-down menus.

By default, all values are moderate.
